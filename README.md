# Basketball Game Outcome Prediction

## Overview
This project involves predicting basketball game outcomes based on various features related to team performance, game statistics, and other relevant factors. We have explored the dataset, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), and implemented machine learning models for predictions.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The exploratory data analysis (EDA) involved a detailed examination of the dataset. We computed summary statistics, visualized distributions, and analyzed key trends in the data. 


## Machine Learning Models

### Logistic Regression Model
We implemented a logistic regression model to predict game outcomes. The model achieved an accuracy of 100%, indicating excellent performance. 

### Random Forest Classifier Model
A Random Forest Classifier was also employed for predictions. The model achieved an accuracy of 99.8%. The feature importance analysis revealed the significance of various features in making predictions. 

## Feature Importance
Feature importance analysis was conducted to identify the most influential features in predicting game outcomes. The top features include `opp_ppp`, `team_ppp`, `team_score`, and `opp_score`.
